# heroku-play
This project was Text Twist. I created a webpage that fetches a JSON from a database that includes a rack and all the words made from that rack. This data is used on the client-side to keep track of words of X length left and the words the user had guessed correctly so far. The webpage will also tell you when you created all the possible words.  

This was the first web app I ever made and the first time I used a GitHub repo. The environment I set up with Atom allowed me to easily push changes to the repo and Heroku would update the webpage automatically. It was so cool! I became familiar with commonly used PHP and javascript functions, objects, and methods. I will continue to expand my knowledge of PHP and Javascript to manipulate and iterate through datatypes more efficiently.
